# Arduino-Sonar-Emulator
A project that use an arduino servo motor and ultrasonic sensor, coupled with the Processing IDE to create a display emulating the behaviour of a sonar-like system that detects nearby objects based on distance through usage of an ultrasonic sensor mounted upon a servo-motor and swivelling 180 degrees from left to right.
